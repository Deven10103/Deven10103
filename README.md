## Current ProjectsüèóÔ∏è

Below are some of my public repositories that showcase my ongoing work and learning:

## 1. Parking Management System
A web-based parking management application built with Next.js, designed to streamline the process of monitoring and managing vehicle parking. The system provides a modern, user-friendly interface for both administrators and users to efficiently handle parking allocations and track occupancy in real time.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track available and occupied parking spots instantly.
- **User Management:** Handles registrations, bookings, and user profiles.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Provides statistics and controls for parking lot admins.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive and intuitive design built with Next.js.

## 2. Jetson Nano Smart Surveillance System
An embedded computer vision project for the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, using YOLOv8 and TensorRT for fast, real-time detection of cars and humans‚Äîeven in foggy or rainy weather. Designed for surveillance and security, the system is optimized for edge performance and low-power environments.

- **Robust Detection:** Detects vehicles and people in adverse weather conditions.
- **Optimized Performance:** Enhanced inference speed with TensorRT on Jetson Nano.
- **Edge Deployment:** Runs locally for real-time surveillance without cloud dependency.
